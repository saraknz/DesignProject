Study of PPG principals and extracting heart rate signal from video footage

• Using MATLAB and its Computer Vision toolbox to analyse video, I developed software to extract the light waves reflected from the face and produce a heart rate signal. 
• Heart rates calculated from signals produced using my software matched to the pulse oximeter used as control for the sample videos taken.
